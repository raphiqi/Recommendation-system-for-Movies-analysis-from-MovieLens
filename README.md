# MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM WITH MOVIELENS DATA BASED ON USER RATINGS

# 1. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

# Objective
Leveraging the MovieLens dataset is to develop a robust movie recommendation system that enhances user engagement and satisfaction within our online movie streaming platform. By effectively recommending movies that align with users' preferences, we aim to increase user retention, drive user-generated content, and boost overall revenue.

# Data Description
The MovieLens dataset, curated by the GroupLens research lab at the University of Minnesota, is a well-established and widely used resource in the field of recommendation systems. It contains a wealth of information, including user ratings, movie metadata, and user profiles, collected over a significant period of time.

# Problem Definition
Our primary business problem is to overcome the challenge of content discovery for users. With an ever-expanding catalog of movies, users often face decision making issues when choosing what to watch. We need to address this by providing tailored movie recommendations based on user preferences, thereby simplifying the selection process and improving user satisfaction.

# Key Stakeholders
Users:
Our end-users are at the core of our business. We aim to provide them with an enjoyable and personalized movie-watching experience.

Platform Owners:
The success of our recommendation system directly impacts platform owners (MovieLens) by increasing user engagement and revenue.

Content Providers:
Enhanced user engagement can attract content providers to collaborate with the platform, enriching their movie catalog.

Data Scientists and Engineers:
The data science and engineering teams play a crucial role in developing, deploying, and maintaining the recommendation system.

# Solution Approach
Our approach is centered around collaborative filtering, a proven recommendation technique. We will analyze user behavior and preferences within the dataset to build models that identify similarities between users and movies. This will enable us to provide personalized movie recommendations.

# Evaluation Metrics
To assess the effectiveness of our recommendation system, we will employ metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Precision, Recall, F1-score, Coverage, and Diversity. These metrics will help us quantify the system's performance in terms of accuracy and relevance.

What is the diversity and coverage of our recommendations? Businesses can assess the diversity of recommendations to ensure users are exposed to a wide range of movie genres and styles. Additionally, they can measure how many unique movies in their catalog are being recommended.

How accurate are our recommendations? Businesses can evaluate the effectiveness of the recommendation system using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, or precision-recall, determining how closely the system's predictions align with user preferences.

How can we increase revenue through movie recommendations? Businesses can leverage the recommendation system to drive movie rentals, subscriptions, or sales, thereby increasing revenue and ROI.

How can we personalize the user experience and increase user-generated content? By offering tailored recommendations, businesses can encourage users to rate and review movies, contributing to a richer database of user-generated content.
